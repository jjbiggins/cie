 * Function name: queueDequeue
 * Description: This function deletes the head (first) node from the queue and
 *              returns its value. The queue is assumed to not be empty.
 * Input: headPtr = pointer to NodePtr = pointer to the pointer of the head
 *                                       of the queue (first node in list)
 *        tailPtr = pointer to NodePtr = pointer to pointer of the tail of
 *                                       the queue (last node in list)
 * Output: headPtr = pointer to NodePtr = pointer to the pointer of the new
 *                                        head of the queue.
 *         tailPtr = pointer to NodePtr = pointer to the pointer of the new
 *                                        tail of the queue. This will only
 *                                        be modified if the list becomes
 *                                        empty.
